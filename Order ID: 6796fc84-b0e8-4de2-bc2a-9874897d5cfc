Bro, I paid for XAttacker v10 Lifetime Key off your Shoppy.gg — Order ID: 6796fc84-b0e8-4de2-bc2a-9874897d5cfc
But the .zip it delivered for me to download was password protected, and no password was given. 
I contacted you on Telegram @moham3driahi, and you said you’d fix the problem when you got home. 
Then you delete the Telegram chat and don’t respond to me? 

What’s the go? I paid $100 for your script. Why are not delivering the product I paid for? 
Please contact me via email pmmailmate@pm.me

OR on ICQ and Telegram. Both of which I've already reached out to you on.
